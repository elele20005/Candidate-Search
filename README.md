## User Story

AS AN employer
I WANT a candidate search application
SO THAT I can hire the best candidates

## Description: React + JavaScript + Vite 
My task is to complete a candidate search application that calls the GitHub API and renders data in the browser. The application's API, which retrieves data from the GitHub API, has already been created. It's my task to complete the front end using TypeScript, call the application's API, and then deploy the entire application to Render.

`"scripts": {`      
` "dev": "vite",`      
` "start": "vite",`      
`"build": "vite build",`      
` "lint": "eslint src --ext js,jsx --report-unused-disable-directives --max-warnings 0",`       
`  "preview": "vite preview"`      
` },`

 *Navigate to the `vite.config.js` file and edit the export object so that it looks like this example*:     
 `export default defineConfig({`        
 `plugins: [react()],`      
 `server: {`       
 `port: 3000,`

## Usage
`Vite` is use to build your portfolio, which will include the following:


A single `Header` component that appears on multiple pages


A single `Navigation` component within the header that will use Link components from `react-router-dom` to conditionally render the different sections of your portfolio


A single `Project` component that will be used multiple times in the Portfolio section


A single `Footer` component that appears on multiple pages

To start the application, run:

command: `npm run dev`

## Additional Requirements
This Challenge combines many of the skills covered so far. In addition to the user story and acceptance criteria, we've provided some guidelines to help get started. Your application should use Vite for building your Portfolio. The application will be invoked by using the following command:

command: `npm run build`
